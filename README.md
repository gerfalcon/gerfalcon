### Hi friend 👋

#### 🪖 My fields
After I graduated as an electrical engineer, I have gained substantial experience in ***Kotlin*** language, ***Android*** development and integrated wireless technologies like ***Bluetooth Low Energy***, ***NFC*** and more but my current love is ***Flutter*** 💙

#### 👨‍🏫  Teaching
I love sharing my knowledge with others: I am giving lectures on Android programming and wireless technologies as a teaching assistant while also taking part in lab courses as a demonstrator. I am also actively working on the curriculum and organisation of the first Flutter class in Hungary. 🇭🇺
