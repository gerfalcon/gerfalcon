## üéì Flutter University class in Hungary 
In 2020, I co-created Hungary's first [Flutter University class](https://github.com/bmeaut/VIAUAV45) at the [Budapest University of Technology and Economics](https://www.bme.hu/?language=en). At present, I‚Äôm still lecturing and have taught over **750+** computer software engineering students in **6 semesters**, providing them with a strong foundation to start their careers in Dart and Flutter. üíô
Recently, we convinced the University to make the materials open source, and I aim to keep improving and sharing them with the wider community.
