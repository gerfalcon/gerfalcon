## Hi friend 👋

### 🪖 My fields
After I graduated as an electrical engineer, I have gained substantial experience in ***Kotlin*** language, ***Android*** development and integrated wireless technologies like ***Bluetooth Low Energy***, ***NFC*** and more but my current love is ***Flutter*** 💙

### 👨‍🏫  Knowledge sharing
#### 🎓 University 
I am giving lectures on Android programming and wireless technologies as a teaching assistant while also taking part in lab courses as a demonstrator. I am also actively working on the curriculum and organisation of the first Flutter class in Hungary. 🇭🇺 (We had 3 semester with more than 3x120 students)

#### 📝 Publications
- [The current state of Flutter in the fintech sector.](https://sparks.fintechvilaga.hu/202201) - 2022.01
I could contribute as a technical writer to the first edition of Fintech Sparks!
In my article, I tackled the buzzing topic of Flutter and a leading neobank, Nubank.
I built my thoughts on my experiences gathered at an interactive industry roundtable discussion on native
vs. cross-platform application development.
